# Week 2 Reading Assignment

## Becoming the Confident Writer You Want To Be

### 8 Questions to Review Every Time You Start Writing

1. Do I understand the assignment?
2. Have you completed all the readings for the week first?
3. Is there anything about the reading or assignment that I just really do not get/understand?
4. Do I know what to say?
5. Do I have enough time to let whatever I have just written 'sit' for a bit? That is, have you left enough time to edit what you wrote?
6. Have I successfully quoted or paraphrased ideas that are not my own, and given credit to where credit is due?
7. Have I referenced the articles/websites/books/etc... in my paper?
8. Have I proofread the entire document before submitting my assignment?

## Peer Assessment 1: What is it and Why?

**Why?**

1. Gives you an opportunity to learn collaboratively
2. Let's you have a chance to perform a peer review to more critically understand the subject material
3. Bonus - your skills in accepting and giving feedback will be improved!

**What?**

1. Peer Written Assignment Assessment - you will review 3 peer's assignments the week after they have been submitted
  - Your grade for the assignment is determined by the grades received by peers
  - Your assessment grade is determined by how closely your assessment matches your peers assessments
2. Discussion Assignment Peer Assessment - you will give a grade and review peer's discussion assignments
  - You receive one grade for both your discussion assignment and your reviews
  - The grade you give for your reviews is hidden

## Peer Assessment 2: Is it fair, and is it actually required?

**How is it kept fair?**

1. Random assignment of who you assess
2. The grading criteria is based off of questions that are constructed to be as objective as possible, which avoids opinions and subjectivity of assessors.
3. Course intructors oversee the process and can override grades as needed
4. When there are not enough responses to discusssions, the teacher will provide their own assessments, and only those who submit written assignments will be allowed to review the written work the following week.

If you believe you are unfairly assessed, then you should contact the instructor.
Include pertinent information like the course name, week, assignment, time submitted, etc...
Then include a detailed description for why you feel that the grade received was unfair.
