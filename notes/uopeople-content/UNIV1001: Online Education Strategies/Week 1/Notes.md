# Notes for Week 1

Love this quote - "While many students first think of peer assessment as a necessary chore, the truth is that peer assessment is a learning activity that challenges you to apply critical thinking as you read and evaluate your peerâ€™s assignment."

Peer grading is a great process where you have an opportunity to not only share your knowledge and teach, but it gives you the chance to solidify your own knowledge as well when considering the viewpoints of others.
