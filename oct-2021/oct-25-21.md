**THOUGHTS**

- **TODAY'S POSITIVES**

- Loved the "Digital Ocean - Hacktoberfest 2021: The Big Push" online event, and got some great information from it. It makes it
- The content from the event really honed in on the idea that there are 50,000 shirts that will be sent out this year, so there is a very high chance that you will be able to make it happen this week! Just 4 pull requests!
- Was able to get to bed a bit earlier and got great rest!

- **JOURNAL GOALS**

  - Update the README.md file to have a more interesting splash page for this repository since it will likely be the most active repo on my account

- **GOALS TODO**

  - BLOGGING - Transfer blog content creation to Linked In! Also, transfer and host original content within my own domain as well. Probably add this to my portfolio website that is hosted on Github Pages.
  - BLOGGING - Select a day in the week that I have time to post a blog post weekly (maybe daily?)

- **FUTURE PERSONAL GOALS**
  - PORTFOLIO BOOST - JOURNAL - Create a template for the blogging content
  - PORTFOLIO BOOST - JOURNAL - Display quantifiable data in a visual format somehow?
    - Running data - Weight data - etc...
    - Duolingo stats
    - Textbook reading - pages per day kind of thing...
    - Leetcode challenges completed
    - Minutes practiced for shortcuts
    - Minutes practiced for typing
  - PORTFOLIO BOOST - GITHUB - Update Github Overview Section to show the "secret" splashpage
  - PORTFOLIO BOOST - LINKEDIN - Update LinkedIn profile to accurately depict my career changes and job accomplishments and tasks
  - PORTFOLIO BOOST - MEDIUM - Create blog posts about the slide decks that I created for Pragmatic Programmer, Clean Code and Grokking Algorithms for the Tech Book Book Club
  - LEARNING - HASHICORP - Advice from Derek, "Honestly to learn HashiCorp specifically start with building stuff on Vagrant. You can built almost anything other than cloud vendor specific resources with Vagrant alone and most if not all of the project repos provide you a Vagrantfile to get started with. After that AWS will have the most example content. Start with easier concepts like provisioning a VPC/VM. But yeah, Vagrant is your huckleberry to start"

**CODING CHALLENGE**

21. Merge Two Sorted Lists

Merge two sorted linked lists and return it as a sorted list. The list should be made by splicing together the nodes of the first two lists.

Example 1:

Input: l1 = [1,2,4], l2 = [1,3,4]
Output: [1,1,2,3,4,4]
Example 2:

Input: l1 = [], l2 = []
Output: []
Example 3:

Input: l1 = [], l2 = [0]
Output: [0]

Constraints:

The number of nodes in both lists is in the range [0, 50].
-100 <= Node.val <= 100
Both l1 and l2 are sorted in non-decreasing order.

```js
// Straight up had to google solutions becasue I couldn't wrap my mind around handing a linked list class/function/object within JavaScript since it's not a native data type that I ever use...

// https://duncan-mcardle.medium.com/leetcode-problem-21-merge-two-sorted-lists-javascript-b5a4de3da319

// My solution

/**
 * Definition for singly-linked list.
 * function ListNode(val, next) {
 *     this.val = (val===undefined ? 0 : val)
 *     this.next = (next===undefined ? null : next)
 * }
 */
/**
 * @param {ListNode} l1
 * @param {ListNode} l2
 * @return {ListNode}
 */
var mergeTwoLists = function (l1, l2) {
  let newList = new ListNode(0);

  let headOfNewList = newList;

  while (l1 != null && l2 != null) {
    if (l1.val < l2.val) {
      newList.next = l1;
      l1 = l1.next;
    } else {
      newList.next = l2;
      l2 = l2.next;
    }
    newList = newList.next;
  }

  if (l1 == null) {
    newList.next = l2;
  } else {
    newList.next = l1;
  }

  return headOfNewList.next;
};

// Solution in the guide I found

var mergeTwoLists = function (l1, l2) {
  // Initialise a new LinkedList with a dummy ListNode
  let newList = new ListNode(0);

  // Maintain a reference to the head of the new LinkedList
  let headOfNewList = newList;

  // Whilst both of the passed in lists contain more elements
  while (l1 != null && l2 != null) {
    // If l1's value is smaller
    if (l1.val < l2.val) {
      // Add l1's value to the new list
      newList.next = l1;

      // Move l1 to its next element
      l1 = l1.next;
    } else {
      // Add l2's value to the new list
      newList.next = l2;

      // Move l2 to its next element
      l2 = l2.next;
    }

    // Move into the next level of the LinkedList for the next iteration
    newList = newList.next;
  }

  // If l1 has run out of elements
  if (l1 == null) {
    // Append l2 to the new list
    newList.next = l2;
  }
  // If l2 has run out of elements
  else {
    // Append l1 to the new list
    newList.next = l1;
  }

  return headOfNewList.next;
};

// Second Solution with recursion in the guide I found

var mergeTwoLists = function (l1, l2) {
  // If either list is empty, return the other list's node
  if (l1 == null) return l2;
  if (l2 == null) return l1;

  // If l1 is lower
  if (l1.val < l2.val) {
    l1.next = mergeTwoLists(l1.next, l2);
    return l1;
  }

  // If l2 is lower
  else {
    l2.next = mergeTwoLists(l1, l2.next);
    return l2;
  }
};

// More speed performant - Literally the one cited above in the article!

var mergeTwoLists = function (l1, l2) {
  if (l1 == null) return l2;
  else if (l2 == null) return l1;
  else if (l1.val < l2.val) {
    l1.next = mergeTwoLists(l1.next, l2);
    return l1;
  } else {
    l2.next = mergeTwoLists(l1, l2.next);
    return l2;
  }
};

// More memory performant - Literally the same one! Probably doesn't account for memory stacking...

var mergeTwoLists = function (l1, l2) {
  if (!l1) return l2;
  else if (!l2) return l1;
  else if (l1.val < l2.val) {
    l1.next = mergeTwoLists(l1.next, l2);
    return l1;
  } else {
    l2.next = mergeTwoLists(l1, l2.next);
    return l2;
  }
};
```
