#### Linked In

- Banner Photo
  - It is essentially a billboard
    - Add your email into the billboard
  - Needs to have some way to invite people into your profile
    - Probably a talk that can be about leveraging Tinder to get you a job - lol
  - NOTE - Because of COVID we are all nationalized because we can work from anywhere
  - NOTE - Spend 15 minutes to mess around with the search functions on LinkedIn
    - 1200 results for .NET Developers in Nashville alone
- Title
  - Recruiters don't have time to read every profile, they will just read the title
  - Recruiters aren't searching "software engineer", they're looking for "react" + "developer"
    - If you want to be called for those titles and job offering then include them in your title
  - Your LinkedIn is not for you, it is for recruiters and hiring managers to find you
- Featured
  - You need to allow recruiters to look up more information about you
  - Showcase things you've done in the past
    - personal projects
    - github
    - portfolio
    - etc...
- Body
  - In this section write the project stuff
  - Tell me about the project from a 30,000 ft view
  - I use X technology to solve Y problem
  - Last bullet point is the entire tech stack recapped
    - Entire Tech Stack and Tools you used

#### How to leverage Linked In to get the job

- Every night go to the university -> area you're in -> search by keyword
  - Every night just go one by one
- 3 Ways to compose a good DM
  - First Step: Admiration/Flattery
    - "Hey Daniel, saw you went to KSU, go owls"
  - Second Step: Be intentional
    - "I have a quick question for you, how did you get your first job?"
    - "Would love to chat with you for 7 minutes for how you got your job."
      - Try to do this face to face
      - Try to line up one call a day
  - Third Step: Try to meet one person a day
    - Coffee, lunch, phone call
      - Who else do you know, who else in your network that could help me out right now
  - NOTE: Put your resume on dice, put your resume on indeed, don't be a jerk, go to meetups
- Go to the place where you know people and where you can start building up that network
- NOTE: I would do this any day over blasting your resumes all around town
  - Build relationships one a day, create a large network, go deep and talk to people
- Jobs board - start whittling down the filters
  - Messaging the person who has the job posting at the company you're working for
    - NOTE: Linked In is the only tool that you can look up and contact any hiring manager at any company and have the opportunity to start a conversation with them at any moment.
    - "I would love to talk with you about whether I would be a good fit for your company."
    - Follow up: "I would appreciate if you had anyone in your network that would be able to talk with me, and I would love to continue our conversation with your company."
- Connections: YOU HAVE TO CUSTOM WRITE A NOTE EVERY SINGLE TIME
  - This goes into their inbox and they will have that inbox with your profile in it stick to them
- The people that you connect with recently comes up on the feed of both people

#### Leveraging

- Post Content
- Liking Content
- DM Game

NOTE: "I spun up an entire division in my company, and it works"

#### Posting Content

- Post out content on a daily basis
  - What did you learn about that day!
    - Everybody in tech loves to give their opinion
- Posting about the experiences that you are going through, and you need to be seen
- You are now in a market with millions of developers, so how are you going to stand out
- "I'm not saying you have to be a full time content creator... start posting about your journey as a job seeker."
- It doesn't have to be meaningful you can just ask a question to try and get a response
- LinkedIn rewards individuals for the engagement almost more than the post
  - If you're not comfortable with posting content, you can engage with people
  - Leveraging basic comments, and making them become relational
- BLOG - Do all of your blogging on Linked In
  - You can then cross post it onto your Medium after the fact

#### Take all social media off of your phone that take your time up

- Habits die hard
- "That's time that I could be sliding into hiring managers DMs"
- If you're on your phone, it's only on LinkedIn, and it's hitting up people's DMs

## Twitter

- Banner
- Tagline
- Have something to link to
- Pinned tweet, pin the tweet about yourself
- Lists are incredibly important
  - Curated ways to get into the ecosystem you want to be in
    - Taylor's list - 100 people in tech that he likes
- Developers live on Twitter -> That's where you network -> where you find out about blog posts -> mute people/politics/etc...

## polywork

- podcast about tech stuff
- vip code: gc2.0
- NOTE: Any place to play right now it's LinkedIn, but if you can handle multiple streams, work all angles
- Search for badges -> Hiring -> Follow -> Click Contact -> Tees you up for what you want to talk to, and reach out to them -> DM
- HIGHLY Recommend spinning one up
  - Founder said, "We want to get past the job titles"
- There's going to be commenting in the future
- NOTE - It takes time, but this is much stronger to build the network compared to blasting out resumes
