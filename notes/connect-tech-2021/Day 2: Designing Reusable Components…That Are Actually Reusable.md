# Designing Reusable Componentsâ€¦That Are Actually Reusable
## Cory House

### Description

Modern UIs are often composed of reusable components written in React, Vue, Angular, whatever. In these modern technologies, creating a component is easy. However, creating a truly reusable component is hard. In this session, we'll explore the tradeoffs inherent in reusable component design, and discuss the questions to ask along the way. The examples presented will use React, but the concepts presented apply to anyone building components. After this session, you'll understand the key considerations required to create UI components that are truly reusable.
