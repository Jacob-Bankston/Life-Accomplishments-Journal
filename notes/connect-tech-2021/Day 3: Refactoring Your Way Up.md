# Refactoring your way up
## Adrianna Valdivia

### Description

One day you might find yourself working with a legacy codebase with tons of opportunity for improvement or maybe you're not sure what you can improve on. We'll talk about finding those opportunities and how to use them to your advantage for a promotion or even enhance your leadership skills. We'll take a journey through my personal experience of moving different parts of my company's codebase from Angular 1.6 to React.
