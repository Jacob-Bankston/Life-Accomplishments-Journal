### Content Strategy

Content strategy focuses on the planning, creation, delivery, and governance of content.

Content not only includes the words on the page but also the images and multimedia that are used.

Ensuring that you have useful and usable content, that is well structured, and easily found is vital to improving the user experience of a website.

### How does content strategy impact user experience?

- Content strategy affects people's understanding of how to interact with your product
- Establishes the product team's authority. A good strategy signlals to the user that you know what you're doing and therefore can trust what you say.
- It establishes a brand's "personality" and "voice".
- It sets the tone
- CS can also affect user behavior, engagement and call to actions.
- A bad strategy undermines your authority, which can break their trust in what you are advising them to do.
- Clear and concise communication is key to creating a good experience
- Content strategy can be useful for building retention of early adopters
- Most if not all of social media is about content that people post
- CS should be influenced heavily on audience (age group, demographics, etc...)

### How would you go about establishing the voice and tone of a product or service?

- Know how you want your audience to perceive your brand
- We need diverse friends in order to understand how to speak to diverse audiences.
- Definitely starting with empathy, also testing it on users before you put it in production
- Have consistency
- When you don't know who your audience is early on doing market research and a lot of testing can help.
- I think this is a good exercise to bring in your whole team to get a consensus on what your product's tone is
- I wouldn't assume how to speak to someone. Demographics don't tell you who the user is and how they like to be spoken to.
- When it comes to site voice, it can come down to the presence (or lack thereof) of image media. If you're promoting a product, you may want inviting imagery or iconography. If you're focusing on documentation, you might not.
- Think about why the user is there
- understanding your product, who you currently are and who you want to be
- When you test, a good way to test for copy (and I have limited experience) is to have users complete a sentence. Leave it open ended or provide a few options.
- In terms of accessibility, age being a factor, I’d try to understand how the user group talks about the product or service. Testing and other opportunities to let users tell share their perspective and tell the story of how they use the product, what attracted them to your product, what factors brought them to your product or service.

### What questions should be asked before creating a strategy for content?

- What do we want to avoid?
- What’s the most effective way to do that?
- Mission statement
- what’s a feasible way to communicate who we are as a brand?
- What is the goal of whatever we’re creating?
- Who should be in the room
  - Leaving someone out of the room who should’ve been there will get you every time
- Do we have any research that could inform some of these decisions?
- What do we primarily want our customers to do when using our website?
- Has anyone done a literature review on this?
- What works about our current strategy? (Everyone has one, usually not thought out, but they have one.) What doesn't work about our current strategy? In other words, why do we need a better strategy.
- has a similar problem been solved within the organization before
- For things related to the users and the problem space. How has it been presented and the results?
- What is the user’s persona? What journeys do they take with the content? What do they do in their lives? Also past usability data.
- Has this problem been solved before, and if it has, is our solution an improved solution to that problem, or would our time be better spent on other projects?
- Document your project, why you did what you did, and what the results were. You’ll thank yourself later.

### What methods have you used or seen used for testing copy (text)?

- pass it to Subject Matter Experts to review
- I’m a designer-developer and I get overwhelmed by this too. There are many different types of documentation that need to be done on a project, and not enough time to keep it all organized for referencing later.
- Card sorting
- Card Sorting, in terms of how to organize articles based on their titles.
- A/B testing, completing the sentence
- Usability Testing/First Impressions (of tone copy etc)
- Blog post testing, ad copy testing
- And don’t forget to pass through Legal lol
- competitor audit
- how does this make you feel
- Testing with users who aren’t subject matter experts
- Words are hard, leave it to the experts
- Reading your type out loud. Seeing it is one thing, but hearing it out loud can help hear the tone as well!
- Could use linguistic analysis. I have not done it, but it seems like it would be useful.
- It’s possible to test copy in traditional usability testing.
- Reach out to customer support and host a work shop

### What KPIs (key performance indicators) are helpful in revealing content value?

- Time viewing content
- Time on page
- Shares
- Positive feedback from customers in surveys
- As I mentioned for company blogs traffic numbers
- Eyeball tracking
- Conversion rates
- audience engagement
- seo rankings
- social media sharing
- unique page visits, downloads, inbound links
- Abandonment rate
- Feature adoption or lack there of might be a lack of comprehension for what’s being communicated
- Are there ways to ask users reading content, whether its through a pop up or a hidden link that they can actually rate how well they liked the content: maybe an option that would say TLDR or this was helpful?
  - I like the idea of “was this helpful”… similar to how some review sections on websites do it
