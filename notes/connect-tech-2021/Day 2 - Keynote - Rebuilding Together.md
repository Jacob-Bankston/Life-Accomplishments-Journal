# Keynote - Rebuilding Together

## Valarie Regas

### Description

Since March 2020, the world has changed. We've lost mobility, offices, social gatherings, and most importantly: loved ones. The pandemic might not be over, but we can rebuild and press forward, together.

### Thoughts

- DevOps Engineer, Salesforce
- When I talk about rebuilding in this context, I'm talking about building something new and wonderful out of all of the things we've lost
- Very tangible concrete things that everyone can do
- We made sure that our morning routine was scalable
  - I loved getting my children out the door so I could go be me
- Got a list of requirements, one week sprints
- Sprint retro meeting on sunday night
  - what went well this week, what went poorly, what could we do to improve
- We're going to rebuild by putting people first and do it with the people that survived
  - rebuilding together means extending **grace** and giving people the benefit of the doubt
  - If you keep your focus on grace and helping that is what can bring more kindness in the world
- "When I was a boy and I would see scary things in the news, my mother would say to me, 'Look for the helpers. You will always find people whor are helping.'" - Fred Rogers
  - You can make the difference by **being** the helper.
    - Not saying be a martyr.
    - I mean keep in mind that you can't always help, but if you can help, you must.
    - Really paying attention to people's moods, and reaching out to check in on them
      - Reaching out to people that seem like they're doing great
- Mental health matters
  - No one noticed that I was drowning on dry land
    - I was only capable of turning the camera on when I was okay with laughing and joking
  - You never know who is struggling when they put up a great front
- If you are struggling, you deserve help
- The easiest way to check in with someone on their mental health, is to be open an honest about yours
  - It conveys to that person that you are a safe person for them to open up to and be honest with
- "I've divorced several people, but I would like to die with Salesforce"
- If you're not afraid you can't be brave. You can only be brave if you're afraid of doing the thing first.
