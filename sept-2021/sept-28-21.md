**THOUGHTS**

- **TODAY'S POSITIVES**

  - I enjoyed creating this personal formatted markdown file, and I'm looking forward to continuing to work on it in the future!
  - I'm proud of myself for knocking out the daily goals today! Checking off the checkboxes feels great :] I am interested in seeing how tomorrow will go with two mentoring sessions and tech book book club!
  - I'm happy to have great friends in my life that can help me keep the big picture in mind when I'm feeling thoughts of inadequacy and imposter's syndrome. Everyone is very supportive, and I couldn't be happier with the people that I reached out to for support!
  - I'm super proud of Ellie hitting her target on the practice GMAT, and I'm going to try and support her in studying to the best of my ability on the weekends so she can be successful in her goals!

**CODING CHALLENGE**

```js
// 7. Reverse Integer
// Given a signed 32-bit integer x, return x with its digits reversed.
// If reversing x causes the value to go outside the signed
// 32-bit integer range [-2^31, 2^31 - 1], then return 0.

// Based on String solution

 * @param {number} x
 * @return {number}

    Math.abs(x).toString().split("").reverse().join("")

 * @return {number}
