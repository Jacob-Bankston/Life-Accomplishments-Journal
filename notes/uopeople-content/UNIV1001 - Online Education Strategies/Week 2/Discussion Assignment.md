# Discussion Assignment - Week 2

1 - Imagine that you have been asked to speak to your classmates and share your most helpful strategy for college-level writing. What would that strategy be?

2 - When you write, what is the difference between writing a paper and writing a discussion post? How does the writing process differ for these two types of assignments? Furthermore, what is the difference between writing an initial discussion post and a response to one of your classmates?

NOTE - This week you have to cite the College-Success textbook (e-book) within the discussion assignment.

Feedback: Should be at least 3-4 complete sentences, properly referenced sources, provide comments/ask questions/have a conversation about their post.
