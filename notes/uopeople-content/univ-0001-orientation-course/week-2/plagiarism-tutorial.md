## Introduction: Understanding and Avoiding Plagiarism

> In the culture of academic writing, originality is paramount -- in other words, is that your own idea or is it an idea you found somewhere else? Identifying sources is so important in the culture of academic writing that to not identify your sources is considered a 'crime': the crime of plagiarism.

Apparently, you can commit plagiarism when you utilize your own past works without citing them correctly.

## Citing Sources

> "The key point to keep in mind here is the why of citation: you are citing to ensure that you have not committed plagiarism."

> "You must provide a citation for any facts, ideas, or data that you took from another source. The only time you do not need to cite is when the fact or idea is "common knowledge" (see below). You also have to provide a citation for any images, graphs, maps, sound files, etc. unless you created them yourself."

**Although every citation style is different, there are some standard elements to record:**

- Title
  - if you are using an article, you should also record the title and volume/issue number of the journal in which the article appears
- Author
- Publication date
- Publisher or source
- Start and end pages
  - for articles and book chapters

**For online sources such as web pages, you should record this additional information:**

- The date you accessed the site (not all citation styles require this, but it is a good practice to keep a record)
- The URL

## How Citing Works

**Your information sources must be cited in two places:**

- In the body of your essay. The most common way to do this is a parenthetical reference like this example in APA format: (Smith, 2004, p. 45). Some styles use footnotes or endnotes instead of parenthetical references.
- In a list at the end of the essay. The same source cited in the parenthetical reference (or footnote or endnote) must also be placed in a reference list at the end of the paper. The reference list can also be called Works Cited or Bibliography.

## The Bibliography

Whether you are using parenthetical references, endnotes, or footnotes, each must refer to a source listed at the end of your paper. This compilation of sources (sometimes called a bibliography, works cited, or a reference list) will be formatted differently depending on the style guide you are using.

## Note-taking

**If you take notes carefully you can track:**

- details about your source (author, title, page, etc.)
- which information came from which source
- which words in your notes are direct quotes, which ideas are your own, etc.


**When you quote the exact words of the original source in your essay, you must:**

- cite the source and use quotation marks (or use indenting for longer passages)
- consult the style guide you are using for further instructions

**Remember**, when you paraphrase or summarize, you must cite the source. *Even if you have not used the same words, you have borrowed ideas.*

**Patchwriting**: When you copy the original text but only change a few words. A form of plagiarism.

The following ways of getting help are almost certainly acceptable, unless your professor has specifically banned them:

discussing your assignment with your TA
asking a librarian for assistance in finding material on your topic
consulting with the Student Learning CommonsLinks to an external site. for writing and editing strategies

**If you want to do one of the following, you should check with your professor first:**

- ask a friend to proofread your paper for grammar and spelling mistakes
- discuss the assignment with a group of students in the class
- pay a professional editor, typist, or tutor to work on your paper

If you have permission to receive assistance, you should acknowledge all the help you receive.
One way to do this is to include an acknowledgements page with your paper.
Be sure to name everyone who helped you and to describe how they helped you.
Some instructors will require contact information, especially for tutors.

**Self-Citation**: While it is often acceptable - and encouraged - to build on in-class work, notes, and ideas as you write papers on similar topics throughout your academic career, it is vital that you provide a clear path back to the original use of these ideas, just as with citing the work of others.While it is often acceptable - and encouraged - to build on in-class work, notes, and ideas as you write papers on similar topics throughout your academic career, it is vital that you provide a clear path back to the original use of these ideas, just as with citing the work of others.
