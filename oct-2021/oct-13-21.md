**CODING CHALLENGE**

```js
//1920. Build Array from Permutation

// Given a zero-based permutation nums (0-indexed), build an array ans of the same length where ans[i] = nums[nums[i]] for each 0 <= i < nums.length and return it.

// A zero-based permutation nums is an array of distinct integers from 0 to nums.length - 1 (inclusive).

// Example 1:
// Input: nums = [0,2,1,5,3,4]
// Output: [0,1,2,4,5,3]
// Explanation: The array ans is built as follows:
// ans = [nums[nums[0]], nums[nums[1]], nums[nums[2]], nums[nums[3]], nums[nums[4]], nums[nums[5]]]
//     = [nums[0], nums[2], nums[1], nums[5], nums[3], nums[4]]
//     = [0,1,2,4,5,3]

// Example 2:
// Input: nums = [5,0,1,2,3,4]
// Output: [4,5,0,1,2,3]
// Explanation: The array ans is built as follows:
// ans = [nums[nums[0]], nums[nums[1]], nums[nums[2]], nums[nums[3]], nums[nums[4]], nums[nums[5]]]
//     = [nums[5], nums[0], nums[1], nums[2], nums[3], nums[4]]
//     = [4,5,0,1,2,3]

// Constraints:

// 1 <= nums.length <= 1000
// 0 <= nums[i] < nums.length
// The elements in nums are distinct.

// My answer

var buildArray = function (nums) {
  let ans = [];

  for (let i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
    ans[i] = nums[nums[i]];
  }

  return ans;
};

// Better Memory answer

function buildArray(nums) {
  return nums.map((i, index) => nums[nums[index]]);
}
```
