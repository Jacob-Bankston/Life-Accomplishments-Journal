# Refactoring your way up

## Adrianna Valdivia

### Description

One day you might find yourself working with a legacy codebase with tons of opportunity for improvement or maybe you're not sure what you can improve on. We'll talk about finding those opportunities and how to use them to your advantage for a promotion or even enhance your leadership skills. We'll take a journey through my personal experience of moving different parts of my company's codebase from Angular 1.6 to React.

### Thoughts

- Getting to know the legacy codebase
- Recognizing areas of opportunities
- React and Friends
- Use this experience to benefit your career

### Getting to know the legacy codebase

You may have not built the codebase but now it's your responsibility to maintain it!

1. How does it work?
   1. Identifying patterns
   2. Debugging process
2. Maintenance
   1. Package updates
   2. Removing deprecated services
   3. Prioritize these tasks with JIRA Tickets
3. Security Issues
   1. If the framework version is no longer supported or maintained, we have problems

### Recognizing Areas of Opportunities

We can find many ways to improve and take ownership in these opportunities

1. Repeating API network calls or services
2. Performance
3. Documentation
   1. Documentation is a feature that you have to maintain - put it in as a Jira ticket
4. Don't reinvent the wheel
   1. There are so many good libraries out there that are open sourced and maintained well!

### React and Friends

- Use React Query - it is so great - data fetching library, caches things
- Use TypeScript - also good for compile time checking and getting error feedback immediately
- styled components - very user friendly
- react final form - for forms
- React Testing Library - DOM Testing Library with React

### How this can Benefit Your Career
