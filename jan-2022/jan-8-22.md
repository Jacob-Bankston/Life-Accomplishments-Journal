### POSITIVES

- Really enjoying playing Another Eden!
- Really appreciate the process for scanning in music with this new printer. Takes a while, but having a digital version is totally worth it!
- Didn't beat myself up over missing a day in DuoLingo or singing with Ellie. Motivated myself that I will not allow myself to miss 2 days, as stated in Atomic Habits! I can be in control here!
- Had a wonderful date with Ellie, and we were successfully able to return Azul for a shiny undamaged box!
