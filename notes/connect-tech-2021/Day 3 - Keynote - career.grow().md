# Keynote - career.grow()

## Anastasyia Flynn

### Description

After 10 years in the tech industry, I have a ton of insights to share with other developers. Everything from tips for individual contributors (such as "how to make the most of your 1:1s with your manager" and "mentorships shouldn't be awkward; how to be a mentee"), to advice for the more senior, more ambitious folks (such as "how to pitch an initiative to C-level" and "exploring career options; being a developer or a manager are not your only options").

### Thoughts

- "My bones hurt, it hurts to wake up in the morning, but I have some insights, so here we go!"
- Definition of "career growth"
  - An increase in pay?
  - A fancier title?
  - Getting authority to decide the tech stack?
  - Getting authority over budget?
  - Working iin an industry you're passionate about?
  - Being able to make an impact and influence people's lives?
- The job market for web developers is booming and it's expected to keep booming for at least the next decade. Thiis iis one of the few fields that has above average growth iin this downturned economy.
- Salary is important, but it's not the complete picture
- consider these before changing companies
  - Benefits (insurance, PTO) - (Europeans take work/life balance so seriously!)
  - Permanent position vs contractor work
  - Company size
  - Team size (Wearing more hats)
  - Who you report to
  - Growth opportunities
- Not a lot of people follow up after the interview with a response with how they could have done better
  - Ask for feedback
    - Sometimes we're not receptive to the feedback that we receive, practice the phrase "Thanks for the feedback"
  - "Don't be a jerk about it"
- Don't be a jerk. Be kind...
- Everyone wants to do a good job.
- Everyone is doing their best, based on the information they have
- Don't be embarrassed of being junior
  - If it seems scary, it's probably good for you
- Embrace being mentored
  - When you mentor others, you are scaling your knowledge to other people, which grows the company exponentially
- You don't need to wait for a formal program from your company to ask about mentorship
- Waiting until you hit your one year mark to get a raise is kind of unusual, I was being paid low for the budget for that role
- What salary range are you looking for, "I'd like to know your range?"
  - It's important for everyone, but it's especially important for women
- Women in Tech - It's worth fighting hard to stick to the industry
  - Men - believe in women, validate their experience and speak to it in front of others
- Once you apply to a company, and the position is filled, then you can apply again once a new position opens. Generally they don't keep the old references. It's okay to keep applying, apply multiple times.
- Conferences is where you network and make connections
  - Jobs give referral bonuses because they want to gain employees that are worth it
  - Network building is a worthwhile investment of your time
  - Get involved in conferences, and speak at conferences
- Applying to CFPs
  - Don't feel bad for the conference organizers selecting people that they know, they are trying to make sure there is quality content.
  - Treat it like you're talking to cops - Everything you say can, and will, be used against you.
    - Not the place for you to work out your imposter's syndrome
    - You're just trying to tease and let the attendees know what the talk might be about
    - "After 10 years ini the tech industry, I have a ton of insights to share with other developers. Everything from tiips for individual..."
      - Your perspective is what gives you the purpose for who the talk is meant to be for, and where you're coming from. You're making it easier for them to categorize you, which makes it easier for you to be chosen.
- Manager evaluations - how you get rated
  - what you do
  - how you do it
  - your future potential
  - the impact of losing you
  - the team balance
- DevRel - if you're bored in the development role, this is a good role to move into, very interesting
