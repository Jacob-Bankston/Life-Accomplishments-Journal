What is the title of the article?

Who is the author (or who are the authors)?

What year was the article published?

What is the title of the journal?

What is the Volume number, Issue number, and page numbers?

Using the information from #1-6, write the APA reference for the journal article you found. The reference goes at the end of your work, after all of your writing is finished.
