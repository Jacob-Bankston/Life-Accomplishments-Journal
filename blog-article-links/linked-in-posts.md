Q: Kait, how do I use LinkedIn/social media to get more speaking engagements? ðŸ¤”ðŸŽ¤
A: A few things (scroll down for the how to's)...

1. Are the words "speaker" or "public speaker" in your headline/tag on social platforms?

2. Are you posting pictures/takeaway's from your talks?

3. Do you have testimonials from audience members in your profile?

4. Have you added it to your company experience section on your LinkedIn profile?

Ok, so those are just more "q's" instead of "a's," but I want you to take a moment and consider this:

The fear of public speaking (officially called "glossophobia?") is the most common phobia ahead of death, spiders, or heights. The National Institute of Mental Health reports that public speaking anxiety, or glossophobia, affects about 73% of the population.

Why is that important? Because I think most of us are just _waiting_ for someone to ask us to public speak.

But they aren't going to, because the base assumption is you may not be open to it. (Like 73% of the population)

YOU have to let meeting organizers, conference planners, and organizations know you are open to speaking business.

No one will "discover" you! We don't wait for opportunities, we create them.

So, state it until you create it. Put "speaker" in your headlines. Hone it like any other skill and income-generating product/service for your business. Some tips:

1. The amazing Baylor Barbee says he tries out new material to rotary clubs as a standup comedian does at comedy clubs. Try it on. They are free opportunities with lower pressure to see what resonates with audiences and what doesnt.

2. "Love who you are speaking to more than you love speaking." - Chad Sanschagrin. Oh boy, this hit me right between the eyes. You know why I don't get stage fright? Because I'm more focused on the audience learning/being entertained than I am on myself. Get out of your own way by caring more about others.

3. Pick 3 core talk titles and 3 top takeaways for each of these titles. Practice the talks until you feel the messaging in your bones. Like a baby learning to walk, it first starts with effort before it becomes subconscious and habitual.

4. In doing this, you will start to view yourself as a speaker. And let me tell you what. The first person who needs to believe you are a pro speaker is YOU. If you don't believe that, no one else will.

Also, follow other public speakers. Studying luminaries is an easy way to start shining. Here are some suggestions: Kevin Brown, Risha Grant, Chad Sanschagrin, Carson Tate, MaryBeth Hyland, Baylor Barbee, Megan L Reilly, Chris Hartley, Keith R. Wyche, Claude Silver, Charlie Engle, Phil Cooper.
