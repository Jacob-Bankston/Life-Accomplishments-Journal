## Dmitry Pashkevich

### Description

If you've had to implement forms in React, it probably hasn't been a great experience. You had to repeat verbose boilerplate code to manage field data either in components' local state or in Redux. Oh and don't forget handling validation and asynchronous form submission! But I've got great news: there's a better way! Formik is a lightweight, intuitive to use, scalable and performant library that will help you tame your form code. In this talk you will learn how to write clean, reusable, maintainable and testable form code in React.
