# Journal for December 21st, 2021

## OVERALL EFFORTS

### 3 main objectives for this month!

- READING - Read 10 pages a day
- GITHUB - Daily Journaling
- SPANISH - Go through all of the DuoLingo course for Spanish

### TO-DO

- SPANISH - Get 100 points on Duo Lingo minimum! Keep the streak alive!
- GITHUB - Set up the daily journal, and push to Github! Include updates throughout the day!
- READING - Read 10 pages today from a coding textbook, take notes within journal, including quotes and questions for book club!

### DONE (FOCUS)

- GITHUB - Added today's journal!
- UOPEOPLE - Finished Written Assignment peer assessments. Was probably overly thorough in my responses because I gave advice and insight for each of the authors. It's hard to turn off that teacher mindset!
- UOPEOPLE - Got through two Discussion Assignment reviews, but still waiting for more people to post content to grade!
- DUOLINGO - Kept the streak alive at least with one lesson at the last 30 minutes of the day. Need to push myself this week to climb back into Diamond league!
- FAMILY - Hung out with Michelle and the fam playing Mario Party, watching Spiderman Far from Home and wrapped up the day with Boyfriend Dungeon on the Switch. Had a really great time! Also, the fajitas were on point for the tacos we had for dinner!

### POSITIVES

- Dinner was amazing!
- Had a solid work day and was able to knock things out!
- Had a great time playing video games with Michelle! Mario Party was much more fun when we did the collaborative events, so I think we'll just do that in the future!
- The video game "Boyfriend Dungeon" is a treasure, and we had a blast playiing it.
