  - Ideas and quotations must be accompanied by proper citation

#### Do's and Don't's for a University Classroom

- DON'T plagiarize.
- DO use citations.
- DON'T miss class. Each class covers a great deal of material and attendance may affect your grade as well.
- DO ask questions in class.
- DO take notes. Your notes are as important as your textbooks. Also, note taking helps commit new information to memory.

- DON'T ignore the deadlines. Manage your time properly to meet your deadlines.
- DO be sensitive to different cultures.
- When necessary, DO give constructive criticism.

## The ABC's of Course Registration

University of the People opens course registration for students over a 3-week period every term

Students are notified by the Office of Student Services when the registration portal will be opened for their group based on their class standing which is determined by the total number of credits they have completed at the University (Sophomore - 30, Junior - 60, Senior - 90)

Course registration takes place in the [Student Portal](https://your.uopeople.edu/) and seats are filled on a first-come, first-served basis.

Students themselves register for their courses using the online course registration system

Registration must be completed by the dates listed in the [Academic Calendar](https://www.uopeople.edu/become-student/academic-calendar-2020-2021/)

#### How Many Courses Can Students Take Each Term At UoPeople?

- UoPeople Foundations students can enroll in up to 2 courses per term
- Full-time Degree Seeking students may enroll in up to 2-3 courses per term, part time may enroll in 1 course per term
- Budgeting up to 17 hours a week per course is highly advisable!

#### All of the requirements in your course are just that - required!

- Do not skip or opt out of anything in the Learning Guide for your course.
- Most students like to start with the reading assignment and then move to the Learning Journal, Discussion Forum, Assignment, and then assess their peers in both the Discussion Forum and Assignment area. Finally, there are the quizzes - some are optional and some are required.
- When you skip something, there will be a zero entered into the gradebook for that requirement.

#### Withdrawal/Drop Options

- The first week, you can drop a course which means that the course is removed from your transcript.
- Between the first day oof the 2nd week and the last day of the 4th week, you can withdraw from a course. In this instance, a "W" (meaning withdraw) appears on your transcript but is not calculated into your grade point average.
- It is always preferable to receive a "W" on your transcript rather than a failing or weak grade.

#### Late Registration

- A few days before each academic term begins, UoPeople opens a late registration period for three days only.
- The days are listed in the UoPeople calendar
