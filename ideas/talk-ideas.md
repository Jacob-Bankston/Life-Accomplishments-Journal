# Paper Submissions

## Choir -> Developer Talk

### Title

Hitting All The Right Notes

### Subtitle

What Skills Transferred from Teaching Choir to Software Development

### Abstract

Everyone can sing. Everyone can code. You may not be great at either, but if you try, and put in the time, you will get better at it. In this talk, Jacob dives deep into his background of teaching choir to middle schoolers and pulls out all of the nuances, techniques, and knowledge that apply to his new role of managing and developing software at his company.

### Description

This talk will cover a wide variety of topics from soft skills, to coding concepts, managerial do's and don't's, playing nice with coworkers, documentation, motivation, awareness, and more! There will be (enthusiastically encouraged) audience participation in fun activities, and prizes throughout!

Many of us take our past experiences and job history for granted, and do not give ourselves enough credit for the skills that we have gained over time. I hope that this talk can inspire and motivate everyone to look back and reflect on what they've accomplished, and to leave with a little more harmony in their day.

### Submission Note

Here is a link to a Twitter thread of mine on this concept of "Choir Teacher things that apply to coding/management."

The presentation will include these thoughts and more in a slide deck that will be broken down into subsections by theme(like "coding concepts", "managerial skills", etc...).

Thanks for your consideration!

## THOUGHTS

- Host code snippets and slide deck in images in a Github repo to share with guests
