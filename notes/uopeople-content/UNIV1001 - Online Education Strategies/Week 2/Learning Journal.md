# Learning Journal - Week 2

## Reflection Topic

Here is an opportunity to practice your peer assessment skills. While this assignment is fictitious (fabricated), imagine that the following is a class assignment from a peer student. After you read the students assignment, please assess the student’s work using the assessment criteria. You can fill it out and then copy and paste it into the Learning Journal.

- Download the Unit 2 – Fictitious Student Assignment. Read the directions for the assignment that your peer was supposed to follow so you can assess that the student understood the directions completely.
- Read the “Submitted Assignment” completed by your fictitious peer.
- Download the Fictitious Peer Assessment Criteria document. Review the grading/assessment criteria, making sure that you understand what criteria you are to grade/assess for this peers assignment.
- Grade/assess the assignment using the assessment form. Make sure that you provide feedback to support the grade/assessment that you have given to your peer - you should write at least 1-2 sentences for each aspect. This includes an overall feedback comment at the end.
- You will ONLY submit the assessment grading and feedback information in the Learning Journal, which is in the assessment criteria form.

## APA Exercise

Every week in your learning journal for Online Education Strategies, you will practice APA format. This week, you are going to learn how to cite a webpage. Find a webpage related to this week’s peer review exercise on water pollution. Then, complete the following exercise:

- What is the title of the webpage?
- Who is the author (or who are the authors)? Note: an author can also be an organization. The Center for Disease Control is an example of an organization that is the author of a webpage.
- What year was the webpage published? Note: if there is no date, you can write “n.d.” instead.
- What is the URL of the webpage?
- Using the information from #1-4, write the APA reference for the webpage you found. The reference goes at the end of your work, after all of your writing is finished.
- Now, let’s write the in-text citation, to use at the end of a sentence you are writing. In-text citations are always (Author, Year). Using the information from #5, write the APA in-text citation for the webpage you found.

ASSESSMENT CRITERIA (for practicing)

Element 1: Did the student present information about main water pollutants in his/her community and the possible causes of water pollution?

-The student provided information on the main water pollutants and possible causes= 10 points

-Only one of these two components were provided= 5 points

-Did not address this part of the assignment = 0 points

Use the feedback box to provide your peer with the reason you did or did not give full credit for this element.

Weight: 1.00

Grade (max 10 points): 10 points awarded

Feedback: The student provided information on the main water pollutants in their area, and listed the causes of the pollutants fully. This element of the assignment was fully completed.

Element 2: Did the student compare the findings from his/her community with other community and discuss the findings?

-This was thoroughly described and answered = 10 points

-Addressed most of the question, but could have been more detailed and elaborated further = 7 points

-The answer was very brief and in need of much further explanation= 4 points

-Did not address this part of the assignment = 0 points

Use the feedback box to provide your peer with the reason you did or did not give full credit for this element.

Weight: 1.00

Grade (max 10 points): 7 points awarded

Feedback: The student only compared their community with the surrounding communities briefly, while mostly discussing the water pollution situation in their own area. Awarding most of the points since the objective was acheived, but it should have had more information and details to support their points.

Element 3: Did the student list at least two skills or interests that could be applied to helping improve water quality in his/her community?

-This was thoroughly described and answered = 10 points

-Addressed most of the question, but could have been more detailed and effective= 7 points

-The student thoroughly described and answered for at least one skill = 4 points

-Did not address this part of the assignment = 0 points

Use the feedback box to provide your peer with the reason you did or did not give full credit for this element.

Weight: 1.00

Grade (max 10 points): 7 points awarded

Feedback: The student brought up multiple points of how to address water pollution issues in their area, but did not elaborate on how the car pollutants were affecting the water pollution issue. Mostly car pollutants are known to affect the ozone decay with their exhaust having CO2 emissions, but it is not more well known how they could impact water pollution levels. More description tying together these two occurrences would have garnered a higher rating.

Element 4: Did the paper meet the length requirements of at least 700 words and include a word-count?

-The assignment was at least 700 words in length and included a word-count= 10 points

-The assignment was at least 700 words in length but did not include a word-count= 8 points 

-The assignment was less than 700 words in length, but more than 500 words in length and included a word-count= 7 points

-The assignment was less than 700 words in length, but more than 500 words in length and did not include a word-count = 6 points

- The assignment was less than 500 words in length, but more than 300 words in length and included a word-count= 5 points

- The assignment was less than 500 words in length, but more than 300 words in length and did not include a word-count= 4 points 

- The assignment was less than 300 words in length, but more than 200 words in length and included a word-count= 3 points

- The assignment was less than 300 words in length, but more than 200 words in length and did not include a word-count= 2 points

-The assignment was 200 or fewer words in length = 0 points

Use the feedback box to provide your peer with the reason you did or did not give full credit for this element.

Weight: 1.00

Grade (max 10 points): 6 points awarded

Feedback: The word count including the subtitles was 506 words total, and a word count was not included. This awards 6 points on the scale.

Weight: 1.00

Grade (max 10 points): 5 points awarded

Feedback: Sidewalks should be one word, which accounted for 2 spelling errors. Effects should be affects in this case, which accounted for an additional spelling error. "Because of the agriculture" should have been "Because of agriculture", and "Water pollution especially we need to do" is missing a comma after the word "especially". Due to there being 5 errors with spelling and grammar, 5 points were awarded.


Element 6: Does the paper include an introduction and conclusion?

-Yes, both an introduction and conclusion = 10 pts

Be sure to leave any overall feedback and tips for the student in the general comment area.

General comment:

Overall, this paper was a solid effort at responding to the prompt and included a lot of personal anecdotes to support the ideas that the author was trying to convey. The paper lacked in their citation of external resources to support and validate their claims in several locations, so in the future, when referencing agencies or entities, like the "Environmental Council" listed in this paper, then they should properly source where they found that information. Additionally, when discussing car pollutants and sidewalks, taking the time to discuss the impacts that cars have on water pollution would have solidified the arguments trying to be made by the author. Ultimately, these are small factors that would have enhanced what was otherwise a very strong essay. Wonderful job providing proper citations at the end in the references section!
