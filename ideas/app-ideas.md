# APP IDEAS

## APPS

- Shortcut Practicing App
  - Main Idea
    - Practice shortcuts in a flashcard like environment, where you have to actually use the shortcuts to trigger a result
  - Tech Stack
    - Electron - since many shortcuts are reserved for applications, it makes it less confusing
    - TypeScript - Good practice for refining my skills since I don't use it often for work
    - Jest - Good practice for TDD
    - React - Good practice for modern React with Hooks and integration of TypeScript with it
  - Expansion
    - Make it flexible for users to add their own shortcuts, tie into internal database of electron IndexedDB or Web SQL
    - Include layered lessons to slowly build up shortcuts under different categories
    - Include several different sets of shortcuts for different set ups
      - VS Code
      - Windows
      - Mac
      - Trello
      - Jira
- Social Media Score App
  - Twitter
  - Linked In
  - Instagram
  - TikTok
  - YouTube 
  - Twitch
- Perfect Pitch Trainer
  - The app shows a note name and you have to play/sing that note
  - The app plays a note, and you have to guess it
