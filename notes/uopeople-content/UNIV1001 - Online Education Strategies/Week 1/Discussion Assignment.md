"The peer group organization leads the integration of assessment with cooperative work, in order to enable the development of communication skills, leadership, time management, problem solving, decision making and increase the responsibility of the student from the results that must be generated by his/her group. In addition, due to its dynamics, the group organization can provide more interesting learning experiences from the student's point of view and more effective from the teacher's point of view, as well as generate new ideas from different perspectives, which leads to more instances of constructive discussions and debates."
