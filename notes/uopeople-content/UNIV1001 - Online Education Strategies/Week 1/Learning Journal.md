### My Response

Purpose: My purpose of attending UoPeople is to fill in the gaps in my knowledge that I have in my new career in the field of software development, and to provide a foundation that can be leveraged to continue towards a Masters Degree in Computer Science.

College Success: High grades in all of my course work, mastery of the material, and achieving my purpose stated above.

Background: I have a Bachelor's Degree in Music Education and taught Choir in public schools for 8 years before transitioning careers into being a software developer. To facilitate my career transition, I attended a 4-month crash course on web development technologies, earned a certificate, and have been working as a software developer for nearly 3 years now. I feel very competent in my role, but I am intimidated about the amount of content and knowledge there is yet to be learned. To help fill in this gap, I began to read programming textbooks. I created a tech-book book club, and have been facilitating meetings with slideshow presentations with quotes and questions for the members. I began looking into earning a Masters Degree in Computer Science, but I needed to take undergraduate level courses prior to acceptance at my preferred universities. The time frame and cost for attending a handful of classes at universities to fulfill this requirement was more time and money than earning an entire Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science from UoPeople. Once I realized this, I immediately applied for this term.

Strategies: I am highly motivated, and have always been a driven student to push for success. I have scheduled out a time frame to complete coursework each week that I will be following and adjusting for improvements as we progress through this course. My supportive wife is preparing for a Masters degree of her own, so we will be studying on this schedule together. I am actively taking notes while going through the material on my computer/tablet, and they are stored online for ease of access to update and use from any of my devices.

Concerns: I am working full time while working through course material part time. I plan on optimizing my weekend free time to cover most of the material on a week-to-week basis. My biggest concern would be with holidays and other events coming up trying to balance the 15~20 hours of class content with them while continuing to work the full 40+ hour work week. It's going to be an interesting journey. Additionally, I have ADHD, and always preferred an in class environment because of that, but I am using this experience as an opportunity for personal growth!
