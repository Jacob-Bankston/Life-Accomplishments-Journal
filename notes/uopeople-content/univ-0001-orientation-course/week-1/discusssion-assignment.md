# Discussion Assignment

## What is the Discussion Assignment, and what is a Discussion Forum?

> In each UoPeople course your Course Instructors will ask you a specific question that is connected to the reading and learning that is happening that week in your course.

> So first you will sit down and answer the question (Discussion Assignment) and then post it in an area of the course called the Discussion Forum.

> After you post your answer to the Discussion Assignment inside the Discussion Forum, you will then need to respond to at least three (3) of your classmates' posts by reading them and commenting on them. This is the assessment part. Obviously you will only be able to respond to the students who like you have already previously posted their Discussion Forum answers already. That is why it's important that you don't complete this at the last minute--because it won't allow others to read and comment on your work.

## How to Submit Your Discussion Assignment - UoPeople Video

- You will submit a substantial response to the Instructor's Assignment
- You won't be able to see other student's responses until you have posted your own
- Click Reply on the Instructor's post to begin. Recommended to write it out in word first then paste it in.
- You have 5 minutes to edit or delete your post before it becomes permanent, aka "final"
- Then you need to assess and rate on a scale of 1 - 10 for at least 3 peers posts
  - You are required to give 3 to 4 complete sentences to justify your rating for your peers substantial responses
- A common issue is to accidentally rate a comment to a reply instead of the substantial response to the teacher's question
  - Change the options to show the comments in nested form to easily see the responses to the teacher's question
  - You will only see rating options on the correct responses in this filtered view
