## Quotes

"If you are directly quoting or borrowing from another work, you should include a page number at the end of the parenthetical citation. Use the abbreviation "p." (for one page) or "pp." (for multiple pages) before listing the page number(s). Use an en dash for page ranges. For example you might write (Jones, 1998, p. 199) or (Jones, 1998, pp. 199-201). This information is reiterated below.

If your title is italicized in your full citation, then italicize iit ini your writing. If it is double quotation marked in your full citation, then copy that format in the writing.

Words that are longe than 4 letters in the title should be capitalized, as well as nouns and verbs within the title.

**Short quotes** - If you are directly quoting from a work, you will need to include the author, year of publicatioin, and page number for the reference (preceded by "p." for a single page and "pp." for a span of multiple pages, with the page numbers separated by an en dash).

**Long quotes** - Place direct quotations that are 40 words or longer iin a free-standing block of typewritten lines and omit quotation marks. Star the quotation on a new line, indented 1/2 inch from the left margin in the same place you would begin a new paragraph. Type the entire quotation on the new margin, and indent the first line of any subsequent paragraph within the quotation 1/2 inch from the new margin. Maintain double-spacing in throughout, but do not add an extra blank line before or after it. The parenthetical citation should come after the closing punctuation mark.

## Online Journal Articles

- If your source is found online, but there is no DOI provided, you can include the URL instead.
- A DOI (digital object identifier) is basically a number that links a source to its location on the internet. This number isn't always provided, but if it is, you should include it in your citation rather than including a URL.
- Unlike previous editions, the current edition does not require including a retrieval date or date accessed for online sources. A retrieval date is only necessary if the source is likely to change (ex. Wikipedia, encyclopedia entry, Facebook homepage, etc...)
