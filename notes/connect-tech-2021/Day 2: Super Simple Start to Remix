# Super Simple Start to Remix
## Kent C. Dodds

### Description

Remix has me more excited about building better websites than anything else since I started using React back in 2015. I have so much to say about it, but for this blog post, we're going to remove as many distractions as possible and give remix the "super simple start" treatment. So, even though Remix has a fancy npm init remix thing you can run (which is much easier than what I'm going to show you), we're going to skip that and build a simple remix app from absolutely nothing to running so we can inspect each bit required to get it going.
