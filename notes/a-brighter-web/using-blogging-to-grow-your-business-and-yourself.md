### Sharing

- Twitter
- Instagram
- LinkedIn
- Facebook
- substack: You get the published stuff in an email
- Medium - Post longer form content on Medium. They will handle canonicalization really well, and it will link back to the original location of the post. You can pull in the content from another location to Medium and it will recreate the blog for you.

### Q & A

- Whether it's right or wrong, share your point of view
- Either way, you should post your blog content to a location that you own, then redirect and link to other websites after the fact.
- "I blog every day for myself for personal professional development"
- Hemmingway app - https://hemingwayapp.com/
- Don't set up 8 different blogs and try to do all of them.
  - Just repost the content elsewhere!
- Having your own website for posting your content will keep a permanent location for all of your content that won't disappear with another company on you.
  - Create the content on markdown first, then transfer into a blog format
