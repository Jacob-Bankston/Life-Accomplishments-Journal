### Description

After 10 years in the tech industry, I have a ton of insights to share with other developers. Everything from tips for individual contributors (such as "how to make the most of your 1:1s with your manager" and "mentorships shouldn't be awkward; how to be a mentee"), to advice for the more senior, more ambitious folks (such as "how to pitch an initiative to C-level" and "exploring career options; being a developer or a manager are not your only options").
