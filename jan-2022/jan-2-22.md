### TO-DO

- SPANISH - Get half a bubble on Duo Lingo! Keep the streak alive!

### DONE

- GITHUB - Added today's journal!
- SING - Gave Ellie a mini voice lesson on one vocal warm-up! Did the patter (1-1-1, 1-2-3, 1-2-3-4-5, 1-1-5-3-1-2-3-4-5-4-3-2-1)
- WALK - Technically walked out to my car to go to get breakfast this morning, but want to bump it up and go for a better walk later! Maybe make a routine to do my DuoLingo while going for a morning walk to knock out both at the same time, cause I really enjoyed that at FSU campus!
- YOGA - Did a 30 minute Sarah Beth YouTube Yoga routine with Ellie!
- SPANISH - Did 3 bubbles on DuoLingo!

### POSITIVES

- Set up a good goal of singing with Ellie every day! I'm excited to work on little voice lesson tips and tricks! I can definitely recommend using her car traveling as an opportunity to sing along and learn songs!!
- Really enjoying watching the marvel movies!
- Ellie hit a high G above the treble clef staff during the vocalizing today! Awesome stuff!!
- Got a single kitkat for each of us, and was able to make Ellie laugh :]
