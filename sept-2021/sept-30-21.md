**CODING CHALLENGE**

```js
// 1929. Concatenation of Array

// Given an integer array nums of length n, you want to create an array ans of length 2n where ans[i] == nums[i] and ans[i + n] == nums[i] for 0 <= i < n (0-indexed).

// Specifically, ans is the concatenation of two nums arrays.

// Return the array ans.

/**
 * @param {number[]} nums
 * @return {number[]}
 */
var getConcatenation = function (nums) {
  return nums.concat(nums);
};

// Leveraging the methods at hand is going to almost always be the optimal solution in any higher level programming language.
```
