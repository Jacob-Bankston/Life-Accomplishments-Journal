**CODING CHALLENGE**

2011. Final Value of Variable After Performing Operations

There is a programming language with only four operations and one variable X:

++X and X++ increments the value of the variable X by 1.
--X and X-- decrements the value of the variable X by 1.
Initially, the value of X is 0.

Given an array of strings operations containing a list of operations, return the final value of X after performing all the operations.

Example 1:

Input: operations = ["--X","X++","X++"]
Output: 1
Explanation: The operations are performed as follows:
Initially, X = 0.
--X: X is decremented by 1, X = 0 - 1 = -1.
X++: X is incremented by 1, X = -1 + 1 = 0.
X++: X is incremented by 1, X = 0 + 1 = 1.
Example 2:

Input: operations = ["++X","++X","X++"]
Output: 3
Explanation: The operations are performed as follows:
Initially, X = 0.
++X: X is incremented by 1, X = 0 + 1 = 1.
++X: X is incremented by 1, X = 1 + 1 = 2.
X++: X is incremented by 1, X = 2 + 1 = 3.
Example 3:

Input: operations = ["X++","++X","--X","X--"]
Output: 0
Explanation: The operations are performed as follows:
Initially, X = 0.
X++: X is incremented by 1, X = 0 + 1 = 1.
++X: X is incremented by 1, X = 1 + 1 = 2.
--X: X is decremented by 1, X = 2 - 1 = 1.
X--: X is decremented by 1, X = 1 - 1 = 0.

Constraints:

`1 <= operations.length <= 100`
operations[i] will be either "++X", "X++", "--X", or "X--".

```js
// MY FIRST SOLUTION

/**
 * @param {string[]} operations
 * @return {number}
 */
var finalValueAfterOperations = function (operations) {
  let value = 0;
  for (let op of operations) {
    if (op === "X++" || op === "++X") {
      value++;
    } else {
      value--;
    }
  }
  return value;
};

// MORE PERFORMANT SOLUTION

/**
 * @param {string[]} operations
 * @return {number}
 */
var finalValueAfterOperations = function (operations) {
  let x = 0;

  for (let i = 0; i < operations.length; i++) {
    if (operations[i] == "--X" || operations[i] == "X--") x--;
    if (operations[i] == "++X" || operations[i] == "X++") x++;
  }

  return x;
};

// EVEN MORE PERFORMANT SOLUTION

/**
 * @param {string[]} operations
 * @return {number}
 */
var finalValueAfterOperations = function (operations) {
  let counter = 0;
  for (let i = 0; i < operations.length; i++) {
    if (operations[i].includes("--")) {
      counter--;
    } else {
      counter++;
    }
  }
  return counter;
};

// EVEN MORE PERFORMANT SOLUTION

/**
 * @param {string[]} operations
 * @return {number}
 */
var finalValueAfterOperations = function (operations) {
  let x = 0;
  let len = operations.length;
  for (let i = 0; i < len; i++) {
    if (operations[i].charAt(1) == "+") {
      x++;
    } else {
      x--;
    }
  }
  return x;
};

// IMPROVED MEMORY SOLUTION

/**
 * @param {string[]} operations
 * @return {number}
 */
var finalValueAfterOperations = function (operations) {
  return operations.reduce(
    (accum, curr) => (curr.includes("+") ? accum + 1 : accum - 1),
    0
  );
};

// BEST MEMORY SOLUTION

/**
 * @param {string[]} operations
 * @return {number}
 */
var finalValueAfterOperations = function (operations) {
  return operations.reduce((a, b) => {
    if (b.startsWith("+")) {
      return a + 1;
    }
    if (b.startsWith("-")) {
      return a - 1;
    }
    if (b.endsWith("+")) {
      return a + 1;
    }
    if (b.endsWith("-")) {
      return a - 1;
    }
    return 0;
  }, 0);
};
```
