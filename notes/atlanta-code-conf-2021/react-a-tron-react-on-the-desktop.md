## Chris DeMars @saltnburnem

### Developer Advocate - Rocket Mortgage

#### A Bit About Me

- International Speaker - CSS, Accessibility
- Love Horror genre, big nerd

#### React?

- Don't try to use HTML or CSS via JavaScript
- "A JavaScript library for building user interaces" - reactjs.org
- Vue/React can be either library/framework depending on opinion on comprehensive-ness of the library
- Angular is completely a framework, no question

#### React Good Stuff

- Declarative
- Component-Based
  - CSS Modules can be scoped to just the component, not using styled-components, keeps separation
- Learn Once, Write Everywhere

#### jQuery

- jQuery - "write less, do more"
- Lifecycle component methods match really well with jQuery methods

#### Why do you like Electron

- familiarity with web technologies
- consistent updates and refinement

#### Gatekeeping

- Do not gatekeep, you never know what you don't know, and it's the same for others as well

#### Axios

- Make XMLHttpRequests for the browser
- Make http requests from API
- lots of stuff!!

#### Use These

- Mozilla Developer Network documentation
- Can I Use

#### Service Worker

- "If you're not interested in using the app offline, don't worry about it"

#### Accessibility

- None of the frameworks have accessibility baked into them
- It is your job to make sure that your mark up is accessible

#### Electron Book

- Electron in Action by: Steve Kinney -> @stevekinney

#### Application Architecture for Electron

- Main Process
- Renderer Process
- Electron Starter Boilerplate
- loadFile loads in a static HTML file
- loadURL loads in the url of where the React app is being served
- They say not to package the electron apps
  - There's a lot of structural things that you need to package and distribute the applications for the specific machines
  - Electron Builder -> utilize this instead because it bundles and packages it for you.
