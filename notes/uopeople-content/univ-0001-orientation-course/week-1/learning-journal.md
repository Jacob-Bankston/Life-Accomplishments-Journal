# Learning Journal - Week 1

In each UoPeople course your Course Instructors may choose to assign specific topics and/or relevant questions as a weekly Learning Journal entry for students to complete. The Learning Journal is seen only by your Course Instructor.

Regardless of the question or exercise, please remember to always use proper citations and references when using someone else's words or thoughts.

## Learning Journal Question

> Do you feel that you understand how the American academic system runs? Are you worried or do you feel confident about understanding the material covered on the topic of the American academic system

## My Response

I understand very deeply how the American academic system runs since I was involved as an educator for 8 years professionally prior to changing careers. Much of what was covered in the reading on the topic of the American academic system was review for me in that sense since I was born in the United States and lived the experience on the side of being a student through higher education previously, and now going through it once more a decade later.
