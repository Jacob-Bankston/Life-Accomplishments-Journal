# Unit 2: University of the People Educational Methods

## Overview

It seems like a lot of the content for this week is very similar to the content from the orientation guide

## Introduction

Assignments are heavily focused on writing and writing skills, discussion is a critical part of the learning experience, and peer assessment keeps each other accountable throughout the process.

### Writing

Done - Read Chapter 8 of College-Success (Pages 271-296) [link](https://open.lib.umn.edu/collegesuccess/part/chapter-8-writing-for-classes/)

Read Answering Assignment Questions [link](https://www.student.unsw.edu.au/answering-assignment-questions)

- Key words are the words in an assignment question that tell you the approaches to take when you answer.
  - Task Words
    - Tell you what to do in order to answer the question
    - Are usually verbs
  - Content Words
    - Tell you what the topic areas are
    - Help you focus your research
  - Limiting Words
    - Narrow a broad topic
    - Indicate aspects to focus on
- If you are given a general topic to research for an assignment, you need to form your own focus.
  - First consider the current trends, issues or debates on the topic (this may require some preliminary research).
  - Then form a focus question that indicates how you will approach the topic.
  - You should also discuss your question with your tutor.

### Table of task words

- _Account for_
  - Explain, clarify, give reasons for. (Quite different from "Give an account of which is more like 'describe in detail').
- _Analyse_
  - Break an issue down into its component parts, discuss them and show how they interrelate.
- _Assess_
  - Consider the value or importance of something, paying due attention to positive, negative and disputable aspects, and citing the judgement of any known authorities as well as your own.
- _Argue_
  - Make a case based on appropriate evidence for and/or against some given point of view.
- _Comment on_
  - Too vague to be sure, but safe to assume it means something more than 'describe' or 'summarise' and more likely implies 'analyse' or 'assess'.
- _Compare_
  - Identify the characteristics or qualities two or more things have in common (but probably pointing out their differences as well).
- _Contrast_
  - Point out the difference between two things (but probably point out their similarities as well).
- _Criticize_
  - Spell out your judgement as to the value or truth of something, indicating the criteria on which you base your judgement and citing specific instances of how the criteria apply in this case.
- _Define_
  - Make a statement as to the meaning or interpretation of something, giving sufficient detail as to allow it to be distinguished from similar things.
- _Describe_
  - Spell out the main aspects of an idea or topic or the sequence in which a series of things happened.
- _Discuss_
  - Investigate or examine by argument. Examine key points and possible interpretations, sift and debate, giving reasons for and against. Draw a conclusion.
- _Evaluate_
  - Make an appraisal of the worth of something, in the light of its apparent truth; include your personal opinion. Like 'assess'.
- _Enumerate_
  - List some relevant items, possibly in continuous prose (rather than note form) and perhaps 'describe' them (see above) as well.
- _Examine_
  - Present in depth and investigate the implications.
- _Explain_
  - Tell how things work or how they came to be the way they are, including perhaps some need to 'describe' and to 'analyse' (see above).
- _To what extent...?_
  - Explore the case for a stated proposition or explanation, much in the manner of 'assess' and 'criticise' (see above), probably arguing for a less than total acceptance of the proposition.
- How far
  - Similar to 'to what extent...?' (see above)
- Identify
  - Pick out what you regard as the key features of something, perhaps making clear the criteria you use.
- Illustrate
  - Similar to 'explain' (see above), but probably asking for the quoting of specific examples or statistics or possibly the drawing of maps, graphs, sketches etc.
- Interpret
  - Clarify something or 'explain' (see above), perhaps indicating how the thing relates to some other thing or perspective.
- Justify
  - Express valid reasons for accepting a particular interpretation or conclusion, probably including the need to 'argue' (see above) a case.
- Outline
  - Indicate the main features of a topic or sequence of events, possibly setting them within a clear structure or framework to show how they interrelate.
- Prove
  - Demonstrate the truth of something by offering irrefutable evidence and/or logical sequence of statements leading from evidence to conclusion.
- Reconcile
  - Show how two apparently opposed or mutually exclusive ideas or propositions can be seen to be similar in important respects, if not identical. Involves need to 'analyse' and 'justify' (see above).
- Relate
  - Either 'explain' (see above) how things happened or are connected in a cause-and-effect sense, or may imply 'compare' and 'contrast' (see above).
- Review
  - Survey a topic, with the emphasis on 'assess' rather than 'describe' (see above).
- State
  - Express the main points of an idea or topic, perhaps in the manner of 'describe' or 'enumerate' (see above).

### Spelling and Grammar

Use a word processor for highlighting grammar and spelling issues while creating discussion entries, written assignments and journal entries.

### APA Style

APA wants the font to be Times New Roman and 12pt font

#### APA In-text Citations 6th Edition Video

Research is there to support your argument, not to make it for you.
Always cite as you write!
Avoid personal websites and blogs, use academic and scholarly resources

### Discussions

Learning is a social activity - when we learn with others, we learn more effectively than we do on our own.

Tips for acing your next discussion post

- Read and reflect thoroughly on the issues presented in the weekly discussion question.
- Refer to the course syllabus and any rubric that might offer insight into what your instructor expects and what you will be graded on.
- If you don’t understand something, email your instructor right away and ask for clarification.
- Posts are intended to be scholarly discussions, so providing fact-based sources in support of your opinion is important.
- Defend your opinions with verifiable supporting information from vetted websites, reliable academic e-books, and reports of research from the scholarly journal literature.
- Don’t procrastinate. Respond promptly.
- Write a logical, well-organized, thought-through post.
- Use the required in-text citation format and provide properly formatted citations to scholarly sources.
- Avoid language that is not appropriate for an academic setting.
