## My Response

From reading through the catalog, and digging deeper into the "Code of Academic Integrity" page specifically, everything seemed fairly straightforward and was expected based on my previous collegiate experience at LSU. I was aware that collegiate level work requires a higher standard of citation and excellence in the writing, and that plagiarism is taken very seriously.

However, there was one portion of the "Code of Academic Integrity" that stood out to me as something that I would have not assumed, "Under no circumstances are students allowed to publicly share (for example on blogs, websites, social media, databases) their work completed at or for University of the People until two calendar years from the end of the studentâ€™s final term of study."(University of the People, 2020) This is very good information to be aware of since I do have a personal blog that I have written sporadically to for the past few years about programming, work insights, etc... I will be sure that I do not post this content up in those locations until the time has passed where it will be allowed!

From my background in teaching, I have seen several reasons why students have sought out plagiarism as a tool for expediting their written work process. Often the students would simply be in a rush to get the work finished, find a resource online, adjust a few words to avoid a plagiarism checker, and submit the assignment. Other times, students would be attempting to gain a higher score than they feel an original composition would be able to receive, so they attempt to claim another's work is their own. For those students that are attempting to be honest and trustworthy in their writing, I have seen improper citations simply because of lack of awareness of how to properly cite their sources, which is a form of plagiarism.

As the educator, it can be challenging to find ways to thoroughly check for plagiarism in papers, so the student might be hoping that by merely submitting an assignment that "looks fine" will be passed along as acceptable. Dilligence is necessary to reprimand students for dishonest activity in the hopes that they will put in the proper effort in the future.

The strategies that I will use to avoid plagiarism will be to utilize quotations and ideas only to support my own written work, and to clearly deliniate between my voice and another author's voice. I will also utilize the recommended resources provided within this course to maintain appropriate citation syntax!
