Use a word processor for highlighting grammar and spelling issues while creating discussion entries, written assignments and journal entries.

### APA Style

Always cite as you write!
Avoid personal websites and blogs, use academic and scholarly resources

### Discussions

Learning is a social activity - when we learn with others, we learn more effectively than we do on our own.

Tips for acing your next discussion post

- Read and reflect thoroughly on the issues presented in the weekly discussion question.
- Refer to the course syllabus and any rubric that might offer insight into what your instructor expects and what you will be graded on.
- If you don’t understand something, email your instructor right away and ask for clarification.
- Posts are intended to be scholarly discussions, so providing fact-based sources in support of your opinion is important.
- Defend your opinions with verifiable supporting information from vetted websites, reliable academic e-books, and reports of research from the scholarly journal literature.
- Don’t procrastinate. Respond promptly.
- Write a logical, well-organized, thought-through post.
- Use the required in-text citation format and provide properly formatted citations to scholarly sources.
- Avoid language that is not appropriate for an academic setting.
- Avoid overly informal language. Discussion posts are not Twitter, SnapChat or Instagram posts. Use appropriate academic writing style, not text-speak.
- Integrate prior readings in postings.
- Offer personal observations and knowledge in an accurate and insightful way.
- Present new observations whenever you can. Don’t simply repeat what everyone else is saying.
- Incorporate your own experience if it relates to the topic.
- Give thorough consideration to classmates’ postings and respond constructively with something substantive.
- Always be polite. Review your post for tone and clarity.
- Be respectful of others’ opinions.
